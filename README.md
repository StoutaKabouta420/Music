## Project Overview:
* **Goal:** Create a system that can listen to music, process it, and generate new, unique music in the same genre
* **Input:** Audio file(s) of music in a specific genre
* **Processing:** AI/ML algorithms to analyze and learn from the input
* **Output:** A new, unique piece of music in the same genre

## Main Components:
    - Audio Input/Output
    - Audio Analysis
    - Machine Learning Model
    - Music Generation

## Technologies and Libraries:
    - Python (core language)
    - librosa for audio processing and feature extraction
    - numpy for numerical operations
    - pytorch or tensorflow for machine learning
    - pretty_midi for MIDI file handling
    - fluidsynth for audio synthesis

## Setup & Installation:
1. Setup Virtual Environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
2. Installing dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running:
1. Start the application: `python src/main.py`

## Deactivation:
1. Deactivate Virtual Environment: `deactivate`
